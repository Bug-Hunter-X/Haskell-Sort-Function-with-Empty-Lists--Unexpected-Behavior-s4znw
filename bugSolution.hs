```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let ys = sort xs
  print ys -- this will print [1,2,3,4,5]
  print $ length ys -- this will print 5

  let zs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] ++ [1,2]
  let ws = sort zs
  print ws --this will print [1,1,2,2,3,4,5]
  print $ length ws --this will print 6

  let as = [1,2,3,4,5] ++ []
  let bs = sort as
  print bs --this will print [1,2,3,4,5]
  print $ length bs --this will print 5

  let cs = [] ++ [1,2,3,4,5]
  let ds = sort cs
  print ds --this will print [1,2,3,4,5]
  print $ length ds --this will print 5

  let es = [] ++ []
  let fs = sort es
  print fs --this will print []
  print $ length fs --this will print 0

  --The solution is to handle empty list cases explicitly.
  --No changes are required as the behavior is consistent.
