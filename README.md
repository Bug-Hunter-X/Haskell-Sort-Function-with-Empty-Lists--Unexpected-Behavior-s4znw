# Haskell Sort Function with Empty Lists: Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates a subtle issue related to the `sort` function in Haskell when working with empty lists or list concatenation involving empty lists. The behavior might not be immediately obvious to those unfamiliar with Haskell's lazy evaluation.

The `bug.hs` file contains the code exhibiting the unexpected behavior. The `bugSolution.hs` file offers a more robust and predictable approach.

## Problem Description

The core issue is how the `sort` function interacts with empty lists during concatenation. The unexpected behavior arises from seemingly innocuous situations, making it a potential source of errors in more complex code.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.hs` file addresses this issue by providing clearer and more explicit handling of empty list scenarios to prevent unexpected behavior.  This involves careful consideration of the different cases and more precise manipulation of the lists.
